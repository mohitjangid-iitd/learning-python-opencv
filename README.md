# Learning Python and OpenCV

This repository contains small practice scripts and demos created while learning Python and OpenCV.  
The scripts include image and video handling, edge detection, thresholding, contour tracking, and automation tests.

## Overview
- Image reading and manipulation (`imread.py`, `Functions.py`)
- Edge and contour detection (`edge_detection_and_contours.py`)
- Video handling and frame save (`vid_1.py`)
- Threshold and binary conversion (`B&W_with_threshold.py`)

## Tools Used
- Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- VS Code and Jupyter Notebook for testing

## Notes
- Scripts are experimental and may include multiple approaches within a single file.
- No external datasets or confidential data included.
